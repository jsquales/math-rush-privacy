  <h1>Privacy Policy for Math Rush: Multiplication</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <p><em>Math Rush: Multiplication</em> is designed for students and classrooms. We collect the minimum data needed to provide optional cloud features like Friends leaderboards, while allowing the app to work fully offline.</p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <p><strong>No email, phone number, or precise location</strong> is collected. We do not show ads.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pseudonymous identifier:</strong> A Firebase user ID (“friend code”) created by the app. No sign-up is required and no password/email is collected.</li>
    <li><strong>Nickname (optional):</strong> A name you choose in-app. This can be synced to the cloud so friends can recognize you.</li>
    <li><strong>Gameplay stats:</strong> Personal bests and session summaries (e.g., mode, difficulty, attempted, correct, average time per question, streak/duration, and end reason, with timestamps).</li>
    <li><strong>Friends list:</strong> Only the friend codes (Firebase UIDs) you add manually. There is no public search.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Core app features:</strong> Run the game, show your personal bests, and compute fluency trends.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional cloud features:</strong> Sync your nickname and bests, and show Friends leaderboards when you add friend codes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where data is stored</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On your device:</strong> Local progress and settings.</li>
    <li><strong>In the cloud (if enabled):</strong> Google Firebase (Authentication and Cloud Firestore) in order to store your pseudonymous user ID, nickname (if provided), gameplay stats, and the list of friend codes you chose to add.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data sharing and selling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> share data with advertisers.</li>
    <li>We use <strong>Google Firebase</strong> as a service provider to operate authentication and the database. Data is encrypted in transit and stored by Google with encryption at rest.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children & education use</h2>
  <p>Math Rush is suitable for school use and follows a minimal-data approach. If a student uses the Friends feature, they must manually exchange friend codes with people they know. Parents/guardians or schools can request deletion at any time (see below).</p>

  <h2>Your choices and controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use offline:</strong> You can play without using Friends or cloud sync.</li>
    <li><strong>Nickname:</strong> You can set or change your nickname within the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Friends:</strong> Add or remove friends at any time using their friend code (UID). There is no universal search.</li>
    <li><strong>Data deletion:</strong> You can request deletion of cloud data at any time (see next section).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Request data deletion</h2>
  <p>To delete your cloud data (Firebase user record, friends list, and stored bests/stats):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the app and go to <strong>Friends → Your Friend Code</strong> to copy your code (UID), or include your chosen <strong>nickname</strong> and device/platform.</li>
    <li>Email <a href="mailto:phi1123apps@gmail.com">phi1123apps@gmail.com</a> with the subject “Math Rush – Delete My Data”.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We’ll confirm and delete associated cloud data. Local data on your device can be removed by uninstalling the app.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is <strong>encrypted in transit</strong> and stored by Google with <strong>encryption at rest</strong>.</li>
    <li>We implement Firestore security rules so each user can write/read only their own data, and can read limited “public bests” for friend codes they add.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>No ads, no trackers</h2>
  <p>We do not include advertising SDKs or analytics/behavioral tracking SDKs. Crash reporting/analytics are not enabled.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy as we add features (for example, classroom leaderboards). We will update the “Effective date” above and publish changes at the same URL.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, or to request data deletion, contact: <a href="mailto:phi1123apps@gmail.com">phi1123apps@gmail.com</a></p>
