## About Math Rush: Multiplication

Math Rush: Multiplication is an educational app with practice and fluency test modes (e.g., Timed Mode, Sudden Death), plus an optional **Friends** feature so players can compare bests with people they know.

### Key points
- **No ads**
- **No in-app purchases**
- **Works fully offline**
- **Optional cloud features** (Friends & leaderboards) powered by Firebase

### Data & privacy (summary)
We collect the **minimum** needed to power optional cloud features:

- **Pseudonymous user ID** (Firebase UID / “friend code”).  
  No email, phone number, or password required.
- **Nickname (optional)** — only if you set one in the app.
- **Gameplay stats** — personal bests and session summaries (attempted/correct, average time, streak/duration, mode/difficulty, timestamps).
- **Friends list** — only friend codes you manually add. There is no public search.

**No ads. No analytics/behavioral tracking SDKs.**  
Data is encrypted in transit and stored by Google with encryption at rest.

### Your choices
- Play completely **offline** without using Friends/cloud sync.
- Add/remove friends at any time using codes shared privately.
- Request **cloud data deletion** at any time (see below).

## Data deletion requests

To delete cloud data (Firebase user record, friends list, and stored bests/stats):

1. Open the app → **Friends → Your Friend Code** and copy your code (UID).  
   If you can’t access it, include your chosen nickname and device/platform.
2. Email **phi1123apps@gmail.com** with the subject:  
   **“Math Rush – Delete My Data”**.

Local data on your device can be removed by uninstalling the app.
